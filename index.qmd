## About Me

I am Justin (Ziheng) Zhong, currently pursuing a Master of Science in Management and Analytics at New York University (Sep 2025 to May 2027). Before NYU, I completed a Bachelor of Arts and Science at the University of Toronto St. George campus, double majoring in Statistics and Mathematics (Sep 2021 to Jul 2025).

My recent work focuses on backend and data systems. During my backend developer internship at Xiaomi Proretail (Jul 2024 to Aug 2024), I built clue-analysis modules, expanded filtering interfaces, and optimized SQL logic to reduce clue-count response time by about 100 ms.

I have also led software and engineering projects in academic and hackathon settings, including Spotify API tooling and the NASA Space Apps Challenge, with experience across Java backend services, API design, and data processing workflows.
